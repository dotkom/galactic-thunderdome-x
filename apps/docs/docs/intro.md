Galactic Thunderdome X is the monorepo behind Onlineweb, the main application for Online, student organization for Informatics at NTNU. A monorepo is quite simply a collection of different projects at the same place, instead of splitting it to different repositories. The current available applications are:

- Mail handler
- ![Core API](/apps/ow-api)
- ![Web](/apps/web)
- ![Dashboard](/apps/dashboard)
- ![Docs](/apps/docs), which you're reading now!
